# Overview

This code repo accompanies a conference talk I've given several times whereby I explain how to make an API call from an Android app using paper-bag hand puppets.

# Features

The app makes a call to the Etsy API, returning the most recent new product posts in an array, and then displaying the first post on the screen. 
 

# Usage & Details

This app is  not an effective or interesting product on its own. It is purely to be used to help you walk through a very simple, junior-level Android API call, as explained by the associated conference talk (see links above). There's plenty of code comments in there to help explain each step. 
Hopefully this helps you in your Android learning journey! 

# ChangeLog & Roadmap
Originally created in Fall 2014 as I was learning Android app development at Detroit Labs. I struggled with API calls, so in pursuit of conquering this challenge I created this project to help explain it to myself and others. 
It was first presented to the public at DevNexus in winter 2015. There have been 2 other, smaller presentations since then. 
There are no planned changes for this code repository, although if you stumble upon it I would certainly welcome any edits! 

# Credits
Major credit goes to the Apprenticeship mentors at Detroit Labs for guiding and improving my understanding of API development.
